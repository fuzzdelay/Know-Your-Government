# Know-Your-Government
Using Google Civic Information API (https://developers.google.com/civic-information), this app will acquire and display an interactive list of political officials that represent the current location (or a specified location) at each level of government.

**NOTE**
You will need your own Google key, which you will need to include in the OfficialDownloader.java file. Instructions for obtaining a key here: https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api#APIKey
